# Task 4.4. Analysis

## Missing feature

A missing feature of this model that would be interesting is to have some minimum time that the doors should stay open at a minimum, this would be a bit closed to reality where we expect the door to be open for some time.

Also, it would be interesting to add some sort of auto-close feature, for example if the door has been open for some time, it should try to auto close, if not some state that disables auto-close is enabled (much like an elevator).
